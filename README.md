Puzzles Polynomial System Generator
====

Supplemental Matlab code for the paper ["A Global Approach for Solving Edge-Matching Puzzles"]()
A Matlab implementation of the paper ["Controlling Singular Values with Semidefinite Programming"](http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~shaharko/projects/GlobalPuzzles.pdf).

----
This package computes the polynomial system corresponding to a random 2d square tiling puzzle (as described in the paper). 

The script `script_GeneratePuzzlePolynomialSystem.m` follows these steps:
- Generates a random puzzle.
- Generates the corresponding polynomial system (see Section 4.2 in the paper) of a user prescribed order.
- Verifies that the solutions of the puzzle (searched exhaustively) satisfy the linear system.

The computed polynomial system is encoded by the linear system (A,b). Each row corresponds to an equation. Each column of A corresponds to monomial in `exp(t_i)` of the `i`th piece. (For more details, see the last block of the code as well as the function `getLiftedValues.m`.)
